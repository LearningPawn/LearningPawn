### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ˜¥ First of all, my English is rather **BAD**. You might see many grammatical mistakes above. If you can tolerate those, letâ€™s just go on.
- ðŸ“š Iâ€™m just a student study at a very common university in China.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Internet of Things.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Internet of Things. (Actually, Iâ€™m not so good at it.)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a lot of things. Recently, I'm trying to understand the algorithms of Machine Learning.
- ðŸ’¬ I think I know a lot of things, but actully I know nothing. Maybe you can ask me some questions about the basic of coding, but actully I suggest you to search it on [**Google**](https://google.com/) / [**StackOverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/). 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Maybe you can send me an Email at x19403@163.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: LP5
- âš¡ Fun fact: Pretty a lot. But recently, Iâ€™m trying to make my own blog by Raspberry pi 3B+.
